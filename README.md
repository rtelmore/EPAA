# Expected Points Above Average

This is the public repository for the paper by Williams, Schliep, Fosdick, and
Elmore (2023+) on shooting in the NBA.

## Abstract
Team and player evaluation in professional sport is extremely important given 
the financial implications of success/failure. It is especially critical to 
identify and retain elite shooters in the National Basketball Association (NBA), 
the premier basketball league worldwide. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical 
modeling framework to cluster teams and players to investigate shooting ability 
in the NBA. The model can be used to evaluate teams and players on their shot 
taking tendencies, as well as their ability to make shots. Using data collected 
from the 2008-09 through the 2020-21 seasons, we identify a clear evolution in 
shot selection over time, including the widely-recognized trend towards a 
greater percentage of three point shot attempts. In addition, we highlight the 
utility of our proposed methodology by introducing an "expected points"" metric 
to compare teams across the league as well as across seasons. Finally, we 
propose a novel player-evaluation metric, "expected points above average" 
(EPAA), as a means for comparing individual players with respect to their 
shooting abilities. We compute EPAA for the top 100 shot takers over the last 
decade and find Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook as having the greatest 
(2018-19 season) and lowest EPAA (2020 - 21 season), respectively.
